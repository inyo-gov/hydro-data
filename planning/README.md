## How to use

1) Start the year by reviewing [`../ANNUAL_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`](../ANNUAL_UPDATE_GUIDE.md) and the checklist for the new water year.
2) Copy the checklist template and adapt it for the new year (e.g., copy `wy25checklist.md` to `wy26checklist.md`).
3) Log changes, issues, and outputs in `worklog.md` as you process data.
4) When the update is complete, keep the work log as the record for the year.
